# Welcome

My name is Daniel, I'm a pharmacist and an open source enthusiast.

## Areas of interest

. simple, minimal and usable software;

. open source bios replacement Coreboot;

. old hardware and its resurrection for today's use.

# Venom ports

Trying a new OS; it's called Venom Linux. Very similar in ideas and work to CRUX, but simpler to install and maintain.

The excellent scratchpkg feels like an upgrade to an already great prt-get from CRUX; it works really well and is updated regularly.

The community is very helpful and always accessible at telegram.

But I was missing a few components that I had ported to CRUX, so decided to port them to Venom as well.

my Venom ports repo is available [here](https://github.com/dani-77/d77venom)

Hope it can be useful to someone else.

# CRUX ports

After a few years in Arch, decided was time to try new things as daily driver;

Tried NixOS, OpenSUSE, Gentoo...for one thing or another, all of them failed to convince me.
The nearest one, that I still have installed in one of my machines, was Void.

The simplicity, frugality and sane config options of CRUX convinced me; it's a hell to start, but once you get to know it, it is fantastic!

my CRUX ports repo is available [here](https://github.com/dani-77/d77crux).

## NEW: 

My d77crux ports repo is increasing in ports; since August I added like 15 or more ports, but having a system that already suits my needs in every aspect, will probably port less often from now on.


# Coreboot

Hello,

this will be my new coreboot bootsplash.

My BIOS roms are available [here](https://github.com/dani-77/d77coreboot)

## NEW: 

After some research I added the iPXE build option to my roms; currently it is only tested on the X230 and T430 Thinkpads.
