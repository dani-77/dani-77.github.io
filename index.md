# Welcome

My name is Daniel, I'm a pharmacist and an open source enthusiast.

## Areas of interest

. simple, minimal and usable software;

. open source bios replacement Coreboot;

. old hardware and its resurrection for today's use.

# CRUX ports

After a few years in Arch, decided was time to try new things as daily driver;

Tried NixOS, OpenSUSE, Gentoo...for one thing or another, all of them failed to convince me.
The nearest one, that I still have installed in one of my machines, was Void.

The simplicity, frugality and sane config options of CRUX convinced me; it's a hell to start, but once you get to know it, it is fantastic!

my CRUX ports repo is available [here](https://github.com/dani-77/d77crux).
